This is a basic Rails project with everything configured the way I want. {Fork it}[http://bitdrift.com/post/4534738938/fork-your-own-project-on-github] to create a new project out of it.

In your fork:

- Create a <code>README.md</code> file with the contents of <code>README_example.md</code>, then complement it with your project specific details.
- Change the content of <code>.ruby-gemset</code> file to the name of your fork's repository
- Execute the following:
  - `$ rvm use .` (activates the RVM gemset)
  - `$ rake db:setup` (sets up the database with seed data)
- Replace all occurrences of `Base` and `base` in the code with your project's name (TODO: write executable scripts)
- Change the Rack Livereload port in `Guardfile` and `config/development.rb`
