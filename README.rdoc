== Base Project

This is a basic Rails project with everything configured the way I want. {Fork it}[http://bitdrift.com/post/4534738938/fork-your-own-project-on-github] to create new projects out of it.

Rename {README_example.md}[README_example.md] to "README.md" and complement it with your project specific details.
